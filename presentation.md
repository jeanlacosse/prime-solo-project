## story

I've been wanting to open up this great bottle of wine, but I've been waiting to drink it with some friends of mine. I want to be able to talk about what we each think of the wine and how they might rate the different aspects of it.

## solution

To help get my friends together and taste wine I created the Sip Central application that lets users rate wine wines and save those ratings to go back to later, like a wine journal.

## demo

So I am going to log into Sip Central. When I log in I am able to see all the wines I have previously drank and taken ratings on. I want to remember how I rated "this" wine I was drinking with my wife and what notes I took.

Now I've got a great bottle of wine here filled with welches grape juice and I'd love to taste it with my friend Neil.
 - get Neil on stage

Now lets enter some basic inforamtion about the wine
- fill out wine form
- have Neil Scan QR code

While Neil is rating the wine I'm goin to rate it myself.
Now I'm looking at the appearance of the wine. 
I'm not totally sure what I should be looking for, so lets check some appearance tips.
    - open tips page
That makes sense, I think this wine is pretty hazy, and has an intense purple color. I'll give it a 60 for appearance.

Now for the nose
    - smell the wine
It smells a lot like plums, and grape popsicles. It's not a bad smell but not my favorite either. I'll give it a 70 for this.

Now we have the palate
    - taste the wine
Tastes really sweet, its not too acidic, no tannins to speak of. I like it though. I'll give it a 60 as well.

Overall I think this wine needs a lot of work, but for a simple sweet beverage its not bad. I'll give it a 70 overall.

Now I'll review my ratings and submit them as long as they look correct.

Here is the ratings page for this wine. Right now there is only one rating for it, and I can see my notes.
- have Neil enter ratings

Now as Neil is finishing his own ratings, if I refresh the page I will see some new rating numbers that are the average of all the ratings given. 
If I want more friends to rate this wine I can share this QR code with them at any time and these ratings will continue to update.
